# SE-19 Assessment

In this project we build a simple Todo app. The frontend is done in vanilla JS, and the server/backend is written in Rust. A main goal in this project, was to write the server completely from scratch, meaning that we set up our own connection sockets and manually parse the incomming HTTP requests and send the correctly formatted HTTP responses.

As this project had it's main goal in creating a server from scratch, and exploring the raw low-level interactions between frontend and backend, rather than building a big application,  we did not find it usefull to host the page.
